# -Building-Model-For-Fraud-Card-Detection-
 In this project, our objective is to create an advanced model for detecting fraudulent cards efficiently. To attain this objective, we've harnessed a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest. and measure the performance of the three models using different metrics and determine the best one.
